# JS-Template

My Typescript template for the creation of Javascript libraries in VSCode.

## IMPORTANT
Before you use, change the following files / properties:

  * `.github/CODEOWNERS` - Replace my Github username with yours.
  * `AUTHORS.md` - Replace my details with yours.
  * `SUPPORT.md` - Replace my details with yours.
  * `package.json` - Replace `name` and `author` properties.
  * `LICENSE` - Replace my name with your name.
  * `rollup.config.js` - Replace my `AUTHOR_NAME`, `AUTHOR_EMAIL`, & `AUTHOR_URL`

## Less Important
This repo contains a lot of extra details that not every project will need. For example, the svelte-kit line in `.gitignore`. You should go through each file and modify them according to your project's needs.
